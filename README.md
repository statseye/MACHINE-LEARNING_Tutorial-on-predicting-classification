# Predicting classification with the caret package

This tutorialâ€™s aim is to present different predictive models and 
assess their performance on a simple dataset with binary outcome using 
the caret package. I am showing how to predict classification 
using the following models in R: 
1. logistic regression 
2. discriminant analysis 
3. random forrest.

The code with annotated output:
[Classification with the caret package: logit, LDA, random forrest](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/statseye/Machine-learning-in-R/blob/master/classification%20with%20caret.html)
